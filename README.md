# What's this?

This is a simulation of Adaptation and Natural Selection inspired by Conway's Game of Life. Little creatures with three different genes compete for the available space. Successful ones propagate, unlucky ones crash or starve to death.


## To Be Continued ...

This is work in progress and I expect to improve some aspects of it. Unfortunately, it turns out that having it built in Python 3 makes it very slow. I will refactor it several times but I am not very convinced that it will get much faster.

Currently, I am working in to apply some ideas to my previously built javascript variant published here: http://www.simaec.net/creatures
